# Bioinformatics Badges

This might be my first attempt at creating a README page, but it’s definitely not my first time spotting a gap and filling it! I’ve always had an eye for finding those research gaps and finding ways to bridge them. So, when I realized there wasn't a simple, visual way to represent bioinformatics skills and tools on GitHub, I decided to create this collection of badges.

Big shoutout to ChatGPT for helping me streamline the process and make this all come together. Explore the badges, share them, and let's continue to fill in those gaps!
