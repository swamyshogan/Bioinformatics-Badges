# Bioinformatics Badges

As far as I know, there wasn't a dedicated set of badges for bioinformatics skills and tools—so I decided to create one. A little quirky, a lot helpful, and hopefully the first of many contributions to make bioinformatics on GitHub even more visually engaging.

Shoutout to ChatGPT for being the brainstorming partner that helped bring this idea to life. Check out the badges, use them, and let’s keep filling those gaps together! 

You can find the link for the below badges [here](badges.md)
